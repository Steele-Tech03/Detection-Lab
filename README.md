# Detection Lab

## Objective

To design and implement a Cybersecurity Detection Homelab using VirtualBox as the hypervisor, hosting Windows 10 and Kali Linux virtual machines. This lab aims to simulate a realistic enterprise environment for practicing threat detection, network monitoring, and incident response techniques. By configuring and analyzing system logs, network traffic, and attack simulations, the lab enhances hands-on skills in identifying, investigating, and mitigating cybersecurity threats.

### Skills Learned

- Setting up, configuring, and managing virtual machines using VirtualBox.
- Installing and hardening Windows 10 and Kali Linux environments.
- Creating and managing internal, bridged, and NAT networks for isolated testing.
- Monitoring logs and system activity to detect malicious behavior.
- Practicing triage, containment, and remediation of simulated attacks.
- Conducting controlled attacks from Kali Linux against Windows targets.
- Using tools like Sysmon to identify anomalies.
- Gaining hands-on experience with Windows PowerShell and Linux terminal commands.
- Identifying and testing system weaknesses using open-source tools.
- Forwarding and analyzing logs in platforms like Splunk.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Hypervisor, Virtual Machines
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
